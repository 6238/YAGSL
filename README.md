# Yet Another General Swerve Library
* In early 2023 `swerve-lib` created by SwerveDriveSpecialties officially became unmaintained after not being updated in 2022.
* This library aims to simplify Swerve Drive implementations while not sacrificing speed or processing power.

# Features
* When a compatible absolute encoder is given it will be used as a remote encoder for the steering motor reducing CAN messages.
* Autogenerated shuffleboard dashboard for each module which can be updated periodically with the verbosity setting.
* The swerve drive is configurable via JSON files, and you can initialize the entire swerve drive with a similar line as the following.
* Simulation support.
```java
SwerveDrive swerveDrive = SwerveParser.fromJSONDirectory(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(), "swerve"));
```

# Library Information
* The library is located in [swervelib/](./swervelib) with documentation in [docs/](./docs) and example JSON in [deploy](./deploy).
