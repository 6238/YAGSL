# Yet Another Generic Swerve Library
* In early 2023 `swerve-lib` created by SwerveDriveSpecialties officially became unmaintained after not being updated in 2022.
* This library aims to simplify Swerve Drive implementations while not sacrificing speed or processing power.

# [Features](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/discussions/29)
* The swerve drive is configurable via JSON files, and you can initialize the entire swerve drive with a similar line as the following.
* Simulation support.
```java
SwerveDrive swerveDrive = new SwerveParser(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(), "swerve")).createSwerveDrive();
```
* The library is located in [swervelib/](./swervelib) with documentation in [docs/](./docs) and example JSON in [deploy](./deploy).

# Discussions
* Latest resources and features will be posted on the discusions page [here](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/discussions).
